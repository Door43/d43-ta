[46-01] ஸ்தேவானைக் கொலை செய்தவர்களுடைய ஆடைகளை, சவுல் என்ற வாலிபன் காவல் காத்துக்   கொண்டிருந்தான். சவுல் இயேசுவை விசுவாசிக்கவில்லை, எனவே அவன் விசுவாசிகளை துன்புறுத்தி வந்தான்.   அவன் எருசலேம் முழுதும் வீடு வீடாகச் சென்று விசுவாசிகளை கைதுசெய்து சிறையில் போட்டான். மேலும்   தலைமை ஆசாரியன் சவுலுக்கு, தமஸ்குவிற்குச் சென்று, அங்குள்ள விசுவாசிகளை கைது செய்யவும், அவர்களை   எருசலேமிற்கு கொண்டுவரவும் அதிகாரம் கொடுத்தான்.

[46-02] சவுல் தமஸ்குவுக்குப் பிரயாணம் செய்யும்போது, சடுதியாய் வானத்திலிருந்து பிரகாசமான ஒளி அவனைச்   சுற்றிலும் வீசியது. அவன் கீழே விழுந்தான். “சவுலே, சவுலே நீ ஏன் என்னைத்  துன்பப்படுத்துகிறாய்? என்று   தன்னுடனே சொல்லுகிற சத்தத்தைக் கேட்டான். அதற்கு  சவுல் ஆண்டவரே நீர் .யார்? என்றான். அதற்கு இயேசு,   “நீ துன்பப்படுத்துகிற  இயேசு நானே!” என்றார்.

When Saul got up, he could not see. His friends had to lead him into Damascus. Saul did not eat or drink anything for three days.

There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. God said to him, "Go to the house where Saul is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again." But Ananias said, "Master, I have heard how this man has persecuted the believers." God answered him, "Go! I have chosen him to declare my name to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will suffer many things for my name."

So Ananias went to Saul, placed his hands on him, and said, "Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Saul immediately was able to see again, and Ananias baptized him. Then Saul ate some food and his strength returned.

Right away, Saul began preaching to the Jews in Damascus, saying, "Jesus is the Son of God!" The Jews were amazed that the man who had tried to destroy the believers now also believed in Jesus! Saul reasoned with the Jews, proving that Jesus was the Messiah.

After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Saul. They sent people to watch for him at the city gates in order to kill him. But Saul heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall in a basket. After Saul escaped from Damascus, he continued to preach about Jesus.

Saul went to Jerusalem to meet with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. Then a believer named Barnabas took Saul to the apostles and told them how Saul had preached boldly in Damascus. After that, the disciples accepted Saul.

Some believers who fled from the persecution in Jerusalem went far away to the city of Antioch and preached about Jesus. Most of the people in Antioch were not Jews, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. Barnabas and Saul went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to strengthen the church. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "Christians."

One day, while the Christians at Antioch were fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do." So the church in Antioch prayed for Barnabas and Saul and placed their hands on them. Then they sent them out to preach the good news about Jesus in many other places. Barnabas and Saul taught people from different people groups, and many people believed in Jesus.
