இயேசு கூட்டத்தை முடித்து விட்டு  ஜனங்களை அனுப்பிக் கொண்டிருந்தார். அப்பொழுது  இயேசு   சீஷர்களிடம் படகில் ஏறி கடலின் அக்கரைக்குப் போங்கள் என்றார். கூட்டமெல்லாம் போன பின்பு இயேசு ஜெபிக்கும் படியாக மலை உச்சியின் பக்கமாகப் போனார். இயேசு அங்கே தனியாக  நடுச்சாமம் வரை ஜெபித்தார்..

Meanwhile, the disciples were rowing their boat, but by late in the night they had only reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them.

Then Jesus finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on top of the water across the lake toward their boat!

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, "Do not be afraid. It is I!"

Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." Jesus told Peter, "Come!"

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the waves and to feel the strong wind.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, "Master, save me!" Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, "You man of little faith, why did you doubt?"

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, "Truly, you are the Son of God."
