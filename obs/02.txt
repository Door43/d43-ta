ஆதாம் மற்றும் அவரது மனைவி கடவுள் அவர்களுக்கு செய்த அழகான தோட்டத்தில் வாழும் மிகவும் சந்தோஷமாக இருந்தார்கள். அவர்கள் நிர்வாணமாக இருந்தனர் ஆனால் அவர்கள் எந்த வெட்கமும் இல்லை. அவர்கள் அடிக்கடி தோட்டத்தில் நடந்து,தேவனோடு பேசிக்கொண்டிருந்தார்கள்

தேவனாகிய கர்த்தர் உண்டாக்கின சகல காட்டு ஜீவன்களைப்பார்க்கிலும் சர்ப்பமானது தந்திரமுள்ளதாயிருந்தது. அது ஸ்திரீயை நோக்கி: நீங்கள் தோட்டத்திலுள்ள சகல விருட்சங்களின் கனியையும் புசிக்கவேண்டாம் என்று தேவன் சொன்னது உண்டோ என்றது

The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.’”

The snake responded, “That is not true! You won’t die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will understand things like He does. You will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she turned and gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their nakedness by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”

Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”

God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”

God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”

God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.
