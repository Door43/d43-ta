===== The Beginning [01-01] =====

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-01.jpg?nolink&}}

This is how **the beginning** of everything happened. God **created** the **universe** and everything in it in six days. After God created the earth it was **dark** and **empty**, and **nothing had been formed** in it. But **God's Spirit** was there over the water.

[01-01] ஆரம்பத்தில் எல்லாம் இவ்விதமாக உண்டானது. கடவுள் இந்த உலகத்தையும், அதிலுள்ள எல்லாவற்றையும் ஆறு நாட்களில் படைத்தார். கடவுள் பூமியைப் படைத்த பின்பு அது இருளாகவும், வெறுமையாகவும், ஒழுங்கற்றதுமாக இருந்தது. ஆனால் தேவ ஆவியானவர் தண்ணீரின் மேல் அசைவாடிக் கொண்டிருந்தார்.
