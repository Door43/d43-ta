Then **God said**, “**Let there be** light!” And there was **light**. God saw that the light **was good** and called it “day.” He separated it from the darkness, which he called “night.” God created the light on the first day of **creation**.

[01-02] அதன் பின்பு கடவுள் “ஒளி உண்டாகக்கடவது!” என்றார். ஒளி உண்டாயிற்று. “ஒளி” நல்லது என்று கண்டு அதற்குப் “பகல்” என்றுப் பெயரிட்டார். அவர் அதை இருளிலிருந்து தனியாகப் பிரித்தார். அவர் அதை “இரவு” என்று அழைத்தார். இவ்விதமாக கடவுள் ஒளியை முதலாம் நாள் படைத்தார்.

==== Translation Notes: ====

  * **God said**  - God created light by means of a simple verbal command.
  * **let there be**  - This is a command that happened immediately because it was spoken by God. It may be more natural to translate this as a statement of certainty that this would definitely happen. For example, you could translate this as, "God said, 'There will be light.'"
  * **light**  - This was a special light that God created–the sun was not created until later.
  * **was good**  - This phrase is often repeated through the Creation story, and emphasizes that each stage of creation was pleasing to God and accomplished his plan and purpose.
  * **creation**  - This word is used here to refer to the six-day period during which God made everything that exists.
